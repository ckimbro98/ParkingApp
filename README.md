# Parking App

This is an Expo/React Native app that allows users to save their location after parking, add notes about the location, and then later on get mapped back to their saved spots.

## Features

- Map that starts on the user's location and allows the user to adjust a pin on where they parked (modeled after DoorDash's map feature).

## To do:

- Notes about each parking location the user has marked (high priority).
- A list of marked locations, with options to map to the location or remove it (high priority).
- Styling (low priority)
